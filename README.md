## Important Linux Info
On Linux, it is easier and generally better to change your global QT6 theme rather than using
Prism Launcher's theme system.
Changing your QT6 theme to Catppuccin and using the `System` option in the `Widgets` section of `User Interface`
makes Prism Launcher look more natural with the rest of your QT6 applications, and changes portions of
Prism Launcher that this theme cannot.
If you are on Linux, please [check this out](https://github.com/catppuccin/qt5ct).

## Installation

1. Download your preferred style from the [latest release](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/Themes/releases):
2. Open your local Prism Launcher Directory:
- Windows: `%appdata%\PrismLauncher\themes`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/PrismLauncher/themes`
- Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/PrismLauncher/themes`
- Flatpak: `~/.var/app/org.prismlauncher.PrismLauncher/data/PrismLauncher/themes`

3. Unzip the Catppuccin theme of your choice in the `themes` folder.

4. Restart Prism Launcher, then open global settings. In the `Launcher` section, click the `User Interface` tab and under the `Widgets` dropdown select the Catppuccin theme you downloaded. Press the `Close` button and the theme will be applied.

## FAQ

- Q: "Why isn't (this) themed?"
- A: Unfortunately some sections of Prism Launcher cannot be themed due to Qt using them.

## Contribution

The prismlauncher port is upstreamed at [PrismLauncher/Themes](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/Themes/releases). We maintain
the sources here, and will PR into upstream if they change so that they can re-release their theme set.
